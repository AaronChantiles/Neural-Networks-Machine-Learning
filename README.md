# Neural-Networks-Machine-Learning

In this project, we apply neural networks for prediction. We use the S&P
500 stock index data to see if past stock performance can be used to predict future stock
performance. The data set consists of daily percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index
between 2001 and 2005, 5 years with 1,250 trading days in total. For each trading day, we have
the previous five days’ percentage returns, the current day’s trading volume, and the current
day’s percentage return. We create a binary variable to indicate whether the stock market goes
up or down in each trading day. We would like to use these available data to predict the
direction of stock market performance every day. We are interested to see if the neural
networks, a potentially more powerful tool for prediction, can help us do any better than
traditional models such as logistic regression.
